some of the files in this folder are straight forward full assignments that allow 
the inspection of results visually on select toy-networks. Among them are:
- a network from cascetta
- merge
- diverge
- simple bottleneck
  
node model test is a specific instance that's been presented and calculate manually
in a paper previously.
the constraints verify conditions in the network, such as continuity.
